# LogSage - AI-Powered Log Processing Engine

## The Challenge

Processing high cardinality log data is one of the toughest problems in modern data engineering. Traditional methods fail when dealing with millions of unique log patterns that rarely repeat.

## The Solution (Exploring)

LogSage uses AI reasoning to understand sparse, irregular log data through semantic clustering and contextual analysis. It processes high cardinality data in real-time while maintaining analytical value.

## Why It Matters

High cardinality data is everywhere , from microservices logs to IoT streams. LogSage makes sense of this chaos through intelligent pattern recognition and adaptive learning.
